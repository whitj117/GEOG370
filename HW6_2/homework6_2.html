    <h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h1>Martin "Whit" Jones</h1>
    <h2>I examined the ratio of the Native American population for each Georgia county. I chose this ratio to potentially examine the displacement of indigenous populations throughout the US. This first map is in the equal count (quantile) classification, therefore each proportion range has around the same number of counties represented. The ranges break so as to have equal numbers of groups, which paints an inaccurate picture as outliers are lumped in with the more normal data. Such a classification could potentially show patterns of similar counties being in close proximity due to the equal count, however this specific data is inaccurate in this classification as the range is (comparatively) too wide in the last class.</h2>

    <h2>This map is in the natural breaks classification. This method of classification breaks the data in to "natural" classes as they appear in the data, as such, it accurately represents trends in the data. Due to the low variance however, some areas on the map may be a bit misleading.</h2>

    <h2>This map utilizes the pretty breaks classification, meaning the class ranges are broken up by round numbers. The class ranges look better in this classification, and in the case of my map, it appears more accurate as most counties in Georgia do have a low proportion of Native American residents, with only one county (such as depicted in the map) having a Native American proportion of the population exceeding a ratio of 0.015. *note: no counties were in the 0.01-0.015 range, and as such, that range was omitted from the legend.*</h2>
