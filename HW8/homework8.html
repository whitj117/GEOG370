    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
    <h1>Martin "Whit" Jones</h1>
    <h2>My research question was: how many North Carolina public schools are located within five miles of North Carolina correctional institutions? I wanted to examine the prevalence of the public school-to-prison pipeline in my home state, and visualize such. I achieved this by downloading from NC OneMap shapefiles of NC public schools and NC correctional institutions, making a five-mile buffer from the correctional institution points, and clipping the public schools that fell into these radii. I used the buffer and clip Geoprocessing tools in QGIS. I placed the new data in front of a green map of North Carolina (green representing land).</h2>
