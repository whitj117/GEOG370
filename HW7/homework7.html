    <h1>Homework 7: Make a choropleth map</h1>
    <h1>Martin "Whit" Jones</h1>
    <h2>This map depicts the proportion of the population of each US State that is uninsured, with the deeper colored states having a larger proportion of the state lacking health insurance. I chose this topic because I am interested in healthcare outcomes throughout the US, and would potentially want to do research to improve the healthcare system of the US. </h2>
